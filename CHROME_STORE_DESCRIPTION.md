MRU-sorted system prompts for Google AI Studio — fast insert, reliable auto-close, private & developer-friendly.

Tired of endlessly copying and pasting the same system instructions in Google AI Studio? Supercharge your workflow with the AI Studio Prompt Library!

This lightweight, privacy-first Chrome extension gives you a reusable library for system prompts. Never type the same instructions twice.

What's new (v0.3.0):
- MRU sorting: last-used prompts float to the top for instant access.
- Improved auto-close: reliably closes the System instructions dialog after insertion (Material Angular friendly).

Key features:
• ONE-CLICK INSERTION — Insert prompts into System instructions (replace / append / prepend).
• MRU SORTING — Your most recent prompts are surfaced first for faster workflows.
• EFFORTLESS MANAGEMENT — Create, edit, delete, import/export prompts from a clean options page.
• FAST ACCESS — Popup quick-search (Alt+Shift+1) + context menu / hotkeys (Alt+Shift+2).
• IMPORT & EXPORT — Backup or share your library as JSON (exports alphabetically sorted).
• 100% PRIVATE — All data stays local; no external network calls.
• RESILIENT — Custom selector option keeps extension working if AI Studio UI changes.
• THEME AWARE — Adapts to light/dark system preference.

Who is this for?
- AI developers, researchers, writers, and power users who want a faster, repeatable prompt workflow in Google AI Studio.
