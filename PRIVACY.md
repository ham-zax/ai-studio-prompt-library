# Privacy Policy for AI Studio Prompt Library

**Effective Date:** September 3, 2025

Thank you for using AI Studio Prompt Library (the "Extension"). This Privacy Policy explains our commitment to protecting your privacy. The Extension is designed to be a secure, private, and offline-first tool.

### 1. What Information We Collect

The Extension collects and stores only the data you create and configure within the extension itself. This includes:

*   **Prompts:** The name and content of the prompts you save.
*   **Settings:** Your chosen preferences, such as the theme, insertion mode, and other configuration options.

We **DO NOT** collect, store, or transmit any Personally Identifiable Information (PII), browsing history, analytics, or any other data about you or your usage.

### 2. How We Use Your Information

The data you create is used solely for the core functionality of the Extension:

*   To save your prompts for later use.
*   To apply your settings and personalize your experience.
*   To allow you to import and export your prompt library.

### 3. Data Storage

All data created by the Extension is stored locally on your computer using the standard `chrome.storage.local` and `chrome.storage.sync` APIs provided by the Chrome browser.

*   `chrome.storage.local` is used for your prompts. This data stays on your specific machine.
*   `chrome.storage.sync` is used for your settings. This data may be synced across your devices if you are logged into a Google Account in Chrome and have syncing enabled.

**Crucially, none of your data is ever sent to, stored on, or processed by our servers or any third-party servers.** The Extension makes no external network calls.

### 4. Data Sharing

We do not share your data with any third parties because we do not have access to it. Your data remains under your control within your browser's secure storage.

### 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy in the future. Any changes will be included in the updated version of the Extension.
