## Privacy

This extension does not collect, transmit, sell, or share any personal information. Your data stays in your browser via Chrome storage. See the full policy in [PRIVACY.md](https://github.com/hcsolakoglu/system-prompt-manager-ai-studio/blob/main/PRIVACY.md).

## Development

1. Install deps
```bash
pnpm i # or npm i / yarn
```
2. Start dev build
```bash
pnpm dev # or npm run dev
```
3. In Chrome: Extensions → Enable Developer mode → Load unpacked → select the `dist` folder created by Vite.

## Shortcuts
- Open popup: Alt+Shift+1
- Insert last profile: Alt+Shift+2

These can be changed at chrome://extensions/shortcuts

## Permissions
- storage, activeTab, contextMenus
- content_scripts matches: https://aistudio.google.com/*

Rationale:
- `storage`: Save profiles and settings locally (and sync if Chrome sync is enabled).
- `activeTab`: Access the currently active tab (after a user action like opening the popup or using a shortcut) to query it and send a message to the content script that performs insertion.
- `contextMenus`: Provide right‑click actions for quick access.
- Content script is statically declared in `manifest.json` and runs only on `https://aistudio.google.com/*`. No dynamic code injection (`scripting`) is used, and we do not request the broader `tabs` permission.
